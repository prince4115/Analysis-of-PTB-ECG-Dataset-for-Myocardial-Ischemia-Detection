# Analysis-of-PTB-ECG-Dataset-for-Myocardial-Ischemia-Detection
This project focuses on the detection of Myocardial Ischemia (MI) through the analysis of ECG signals using the PTB ECG dataset, a well-known and widely used resource for cardiovascular research. The dataset comprises ECG recordings from patients with various heart conditions, including MI, providing a rich source of data for developing and testing machine learning models.

Data Preprocessing
The ECG signals were initially stored in .mat files, which were processed using the WFDB (Waveform Database) libraryâ€”a comprehensive toolset for handling physiological signals. The raw signals were first converted into a 2-D format, making them suitable for further analysis and model input. Each ECG signal was meticulously labeled, categorizing the presence of Myocardial Ischemia based on expert annotations provided within the dataset.

To ensure the integrity and clarity of the ECG signals, several preprocessing steps were employed. These included filtering techniques designed to reduce baseline wander, which is a common issue caused by patient movement or respiration, and to eliminate noise from the signal. This step was crucial as it significantly enhanced the quality of the data, enabling the machine learning models to focus on the relevant features of the ECG signals without being misled by extraneous artifacts.

Model Development
For the detection of Myocardial Ischemia, a deep learning approach was adopted, specifically utilizing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that are particularly well-suited for sequential data, such as time-series data found in ECG signals. The model architecture consisted of 10 layers, incorporating batch normalization and dropout layers to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. The learning rate was carefully set at 0.0001, a value determined through hyperparameter tuning to balance convergence speed and model performance.

The LSTM model was trained using the ADAM optimizer, which is known for its efficiency and effectiveness in handling noisy gradients and non-stationary objectives. Although the model was also experimented with using other optimizers, such as Adagrad, the results were less satisfactory, highlighting the importance of optimizer selection in deep learning workflows. After a series of optimizations, the best-performing model was identified and saved for further analysis.

Comparative Analysis: 3-Lead vs. 12-Lead ECG Systems
Following the initial development, the project extended its analysis by applying the LSTM model to a 3-lead ECG system derived from the same PTB dataset. The leads selected were II, III, and AVF, which are critical for detecting abnormalities in the Right Coronary Artery (RCA). These leads are particularly valuable in identifying ischemic events that may not be as apparent in other lead configurations.

A comprehensive analysis was conducted to compare the performance of the 3-lead system against the traditional 12-lead ECG system. The results indicated that the 3-lead system, while using fewer data points, demonstrated greater specificity and sensitivity in detecting MI, particularly for the regions of the heart associated with the RCA. This finding is significant as it suggests that the 3-lead system could be a more efficient and targeted approach for MI detection, especially in situations where computational resources are limited or when a rapid diagnosis is required.

However, it is important to note that the 12-lead system still exhibited higher overall accuracy due to the larger volume of data it provides. The additional leads in the 12-lead system capture more comprehensive information about the heart's electrical activity, which contributes to its superior accuracy in detecting a broader range of ischemic events. Nevertheless, the 3-lead system's performance is promising, particularly in its ability to maintain high specificity and sensitivity with a reduced dataset, making it an attractive option for real-time applications in portable or wearable devices.

Insights and Implications
The findings of this project have important implications for the development of ECG-based diagnostic tools. The success of the 3-lead system in this study suggests that it is possible to develop efficient, low-cost, and portable diagnostic systems without sacrificing detection accuracy for specific types of ischemic heart disease. This could be particularly beneficial in resource-constrained settings or in scenarios where quick, reliable detection is critical, such as in emergency medical services or remote monitoring applications.

Furthermore, the use of advanced deep learning models like LSTM, which can effectively handle the sequential nature of ECG data, highlights the potential of machine learning to revolutionize the field of cardiovascular diagnostics. The ability to process and analyze ECG signals in real-time opens up new possibilities for early detection and intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden of cardiovascular diseases.

Conclusion
In conclusion, while the 12-lead system remains the gold standard in clinical settings, the 3-lead system, as demonstrated in this project, offers a compelling alternative for specific applications. Future research should continue to explore the optimization of these systems, potentially integrating other forms of data or additional features to further enhance their accuracy and applicability in diverse medical environments
